The original purpose of this project was a client/server application to book a room at a hotel.
We can change that to some other database.
Also, this is just an example. There are many ways to design GUI.

TODO (suggestion)
- Add database connection
- Modify to show data on grid
- Is there a better way to do the grid?
- Run Javadoc on the program and see what happens...
