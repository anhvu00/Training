This is my attempt to learn HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. It's not perfect but shows some of the possibilities.
There is a few bugs in the scripts. For example, the carousel won't work correctly
if you roll in one direction past 6 times. The carousel is from an online class.
I have more CSS files than I use because I'm still testing for a good one.
The folders are not well-named. They should be \css, \lib, and \images (or something like that).
Pay attention to:
- Comments in the code
- Be consistent with quote and double quotes
How to run:
- Download everything, then open index.html with your browser.
- Only works in Chrome, something with html5....
